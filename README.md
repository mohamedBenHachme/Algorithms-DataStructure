# Algorithms-DataStructure

this repository will contain java classes for the most known and classical algorithms and data structures and also will be some of applications on these data structures.
Each class contains a driver function in order to implement and use the different functions for a certain data structure...
This repository is not complete yet but every time I'll be adding new things to it. 
# DEMO
in order to run one of these files just download the file .java and type in the commande line the following commandes :
  javac ClassName.java
  java ClassName
Or you can use an IDE which will be better.
